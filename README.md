# Sign Language Detector

## Overview
The **Sign Language Detector** is a Python-based project that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to recognize and interpret sign language gestures. This tool aims to bridge communication gaps by enabling real-time sign language detection and translation.

## Features
- Real-time sign language detection using OpenCV.
- Machine learning model trained to recognize different hand gestures.
- User-friendly interface for gesture visualization.
- Supports multiple sign language alphabets (ASL, ISL, etc.).
- Scalable and customizable for additional gestures and languages.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning model)
- MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
- NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/enigmatic07/SignLanguageDetector.git
   cd SignLanguageDetector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Launch the application.
- Place your hand in front of the camera and make a sign.
- The system will detect and interpret the gesture.
- The recognized sign will be displayed on the screen.

## Model Training
To train the model on custom gestures:
1. Collect images of different gestures.
2. Label and preprocess the data.
3. Train the model using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. Evaluate and fine-tune for better accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- Support for dynamic gestures and full sentence translation.
- Integration with speech synthesis for spoken output.
- Mobile and web-based deployment.
